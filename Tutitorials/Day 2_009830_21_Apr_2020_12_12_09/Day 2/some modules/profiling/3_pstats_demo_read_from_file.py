"""
The pstats.Stats class reads profile results from a file and formats them in various ways.

The file cProfile can also be invoked as a script to profile another script. For example:


python -m cProfile [-o output_file] [-s sort_order] myscript.py


-o writes the profile results to a file instead of to stdout

-s specifies one of the sort_stats() sort values to sort the output by. This only applies when -o is not supplied.

The pstats moduleâ€™s Stats class has a variety of methods for manipulating and printing the data saved into a profile
results file:
The strip_dirs() method removed the extraneous path from all the module names. The sort_stats() method sorted all the
entries according to the standard module/line/name string that is printed. The print_stats() method printed out all the statistics.
